# Project 3 - Programming Project

Using the database that you created for project 2, write Python programs to do the following:
- display an overview of the relevant data, excluding data that isnâ€™t relevant to a user, such as autonumber keys
- allow a user to search for data based on an input value
- allow a user to add data to one or more tables
- allow a user to modify data in one or more tables
- allow a user to delete data from one or more tables

You can write a separate program for each requirement or combine requirements into fewer programs.

**To submit this assignment, commit your programs and your SQL script from project 2 to this repository and then submit the related Blackboard assignment.**
